# Every-Word Ruby Twitter Bot

Every-word is a simple ruby program to create "every word" twitter bots in the style of [Every Orb](https://twitter.com/everyorb) and [Every Lesbian](https://twitter.com/every_lesbian).

# Easy Installation via Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.build.io/deploy/button.svg)](https://build.io/deploy)

Click the Heroku deploy button above, and fill in the required variables with the corresponding API keys from Wordnik and Twitter, then choose your word.

After the app is set up, go to the app's overview screen and click on the scheduler addon. Add a new task, type in "ruby start.rb" and set the frequency you'd like the bot to update to Twitter to at.

# Installation (non-Heroku)

A readme file with more detailed instructions is coming, but in the meantime if you want to use it, just make sure to set the following env variables:

```
CONSUMER_KEY=
CONSUMER_SECRET=
ACCESS_TOKEN=
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
WORDNIK_KEY=
EVERY_WORD_WORD=
```

The first four vars correspond to your Twitter API credentials, Wordnik corresponds to your Wordnik API key, and "EVERY_WORD_WORD" corresponds to whatever word you would like your bot to be dedicated to.

The following are optional env variables for the Wordnik query, along with their default values.
 
```
HAS_DICTIONARY_DEF=true
INCLUDE_PART_OF_SPEECH=""
EXCLUDE_PART_OF_SPEECH="proper-noun"
MIN_CORPUS_COUNT=5000
MAX_CORPUS_COUNT=-1
MIN_DICTIONARY_COUNT=1
MAX_DICTIONARY_COUNT=-1
MIN_LENGTH=3
MAX_LENGTH=-1
```
